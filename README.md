# nginx-ingress-with-k8s

### some ideas:
- build & install nginx from source in the alpine docker image
- create an AMI for the image to be able to easily deploy to AWS
- understand options to deploy in k8s in aws
- research the nginx ingress controller for k8s and maybe build on top of it?
- do more fancy stuff like including logging with prometheus or something
- look at using something like vault for security if time permits although this might not be applicable
